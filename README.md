# rock-paper-scissors

This repository is for the Rock Paper Scissors project on TheOdinProject.com.

Update:
After getting confused with some of the code and googling how to accomplish certain tasks, I have gotten the game to behave the way it should per the project assigment. This is the first javascript code I've written to completion, which feels amazing!

Update #2:
I'm updating the README.md file so I can commit and push this repository onto Github, and see if it loads the index page for the live preview.
