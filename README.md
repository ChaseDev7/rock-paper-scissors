# rock-paper-scissors

This repository is for the Rock Paper Scissors project on TheOdinProject.com.

Update:
After getting confused with some of the code and googling how to accomplish certain tasks, I have gotten the game to behave the way it should per the project assigment. This is the first javascript code I've written to completion, which feels amazing!

Update #2:
I'm updating the README.md file so I can commit and push this repository onto Github, and see if it loads the index page for the live preview.

Update #3 (March, 2023):
I've went through the Revisiting Rock, Paper, Scissors section of the Foundation Course on TheOdinProject, and added a UI to the game, so you can click buttons instead of entering options through a prompt. I've also made the game end after either the player or the computer wins 5 rounds, and a reset button to restart the game.
